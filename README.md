# restaurant-menus
A simple restaurant menu app. This data-driven web app was created with Flask framework for Python and uses the SQLAlchemy (an open source ORM for python) to communicate with the database. 


## Vagrant

For easy configuration, I use Vagrant to run the app. If you want to use Vagrant, I suggest installing VirtualBox 5.1 along with Vagrant.

Using terminal, navigate to the project folder and then use ```vagrant up``` to run your virtual machine. Use ```vagrant ssh``` to lof into the virtual machine and run the python file. You should then be able to access the site at http://localhost:5000/
